scaffold. n. A temporary framework or platform.

This code is not stable for production use. I welcome testing, feedback, and contributions.

The HTML 5 Scaffold is being built in a modular way to allow people to pick and choose.

The first module is the Sectioning Module which includes a JavaScript-based parsing fix to allow IE to correctly parse these new elements, as well as CSS to set the core and default styles as well as a reset that can be used with user agents that have added support for these elements.
