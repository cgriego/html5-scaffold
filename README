HTML 5 Scaffold: Front-end modules to help you use HTML 5 today.
scaffold. n. A temporary framework or platform.

This code is not stable for production use. I welcome testing, feedback, and contributions.

Modules:
  - Sectioning (article, aside, footer, header, hgroup, nav, section)
  - Phrasing (abbr, mark, meter, progress, time)

Common module files:
  - parsing-ie.js  Allows IE to correctly parse and style new HTML 5 elements.
  - core.css       Applies core styles for new elements such as display type.
  - defaults.css   Applies default styles to an element that a browser would be expected to apply.
  - reset.css      Applies reset styles for new elements should a browser add support.
